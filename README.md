Multiple Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning
Overview
This project is a web-based multiple disease prediction system that utilizes machine learning models to predict the likelihood of various diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, and breast cancer. The system is built using Django for the backend API, React for the frontend UI, and machine learning models implemented in Python.

Tech Stack
Backend (API): Django, Django REST Framework

Frontend (UI): React.js

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

Development Environment: Anaconda, Spyder IDE

Database: SQLite / PostgreSQL (mention the one you used)

Features
âœ… Predicts multiple diseases based on patient input
âœ… Uses trained ML models for accurate diagnosis
âœ… REST API built with Django for efficient data handling
âœ… Interactive UI built with React for a seamless user experience
âœ… Secure and scalable architecture for future enhancements

How to Run the Project
1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/anaghagaikar25/Multiple-disease-prediction-system.git  
cd multiple-disease-prediction

3. Setup Backend (Django API)

cd backend  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
python manage.py migrate  
python manage.py runserver  
API will run at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

3. Setup Frontend (React UI)

cd frontend  
npm install  
npm start  
UI will be available at http://localhost:3000/
